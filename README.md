Thurston's sphere eversion algorithm is ported to javascript and visualized using [three.js](https://threejs.org/).



Here is the famous explainer video [Outside In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO61D9x6lNY). And more info about the source C++ program [here](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/mmcguffin/eversion/)

From what i can tell this algorithm almost forgotten on the internet. Almost 3/4 of the links i find are dead. I hope this project can help keep it alive.

In the future i will add the three.js library to this repo so it is a little bit more future proof.
